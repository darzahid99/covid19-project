In this project, I have taken COVID-19 dataset from 'OUR WORLD IN DATA' and understand how the disease has spread across different countries. 
In this project I have performed some data manipulation and visualization operations on top of the dataset.
I also have implemented linear regression algorithm to understand the number of active cases and recovered cases.
